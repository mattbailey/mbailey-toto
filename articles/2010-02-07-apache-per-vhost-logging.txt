title: Apache per-vhost logging
date: 07/02/2010

I wrote this little article before; after solving a problem to get zero configuration apache vhosts with separate logs in apache.  It's a minimal configuration that is extremely fast due to apache's bulit-in perl acceleration.

Fit this in with your apache config, then you can simply create directories under /web/hosts and they will automatically be your vhosts.  No restarting apache, no extra config.

~

	<VirtualHost IP ADDRESS> 
	  # get the server name from the Host: header 
	  UseCanonicalName Off

	  # Farm logfiles out to small script to dump into host/logs dir 
	  LogFormat "%V %h %l %u %t %r %s %b" vcommon 
	  CustomLog "| /usr/local/bin/logpush.pl /web/hosts" vcommon 

	  # include the server name in the filenames used to satisfy requests 
	  VirtualDocumentRoot /web/hosts/%0/htdocs 
	  VirtualScriptAlias /web/hosts/%0/cgi-bin 
	</VirtualHost>

And here is the logpush.pl file:

	#!/usr/bin/perl 
	use strict; 
	while( my $line=<STDIN> ) { 
	  my @logline = split(/ /, $line); 
	  mkdir "/$ARGV[0]/$logline[0]/logs"; 
	  open(LOG, ">>/$ARGV[0]/$logline[0]/logs/access_log");
	  print LOG "$line"; close(LOG); 
	} 
	exit(0);
