title: Bonding and bridging for LXC
date: 19/04/2010

I'm using [LXC](http://lxc.sf.net/) for a project at work. Setting up the networking became a bit complex, so I did a bit of scripting to go around ubuntu server's standard interfaces file. My requirements here are that I have two (or really n) physical interfaces that need to be bonded with LACP, and a bridge interface on top of the bond0 interface.

This config is probably useful for other virtualization set ups, but YMMV; this is really just for LXC on Ubuntu Server (Lucid). Click read on to see the scripts.

My /etc/network/interfaces file looks like this:

    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    auto bond0
    iface bond0 inet static
    address <ADDRESS>
    gateway <VALID GATEWAY>
    netmask <NETMASK>
    slaves eth0 eth1
    bond-mode 4  # This is for 802.3ad; must match the pre-up line
    bond-miimon 100  # This also needs to match the pre-up modprobe
    dns-nameservers <SOME DNS SERVER>
    pre-up /sbin/modprobe bonding mode=4 miimon=100  # check kernel docs for the right mode
    post-up /usr/local/bin/urizen-net.sh up  # my little script for bridging
    pre-down /usr/local/bin/urizen-net.sh down

/usr/local/bin/urizen-net.sh:

    #!/bin/bash
    
    IP="<PRIMARY HOST IP>"
    MASK="<HOST IP NETMASK>"
    GATEWAY="<HOST GATEWAY>"

    if [ "$1" = "up" ]
    then
        # Finish the bond
        /sbin/ifenslave bond0 eth0 eth1

        # Bring up the bridge
        /usr/sbin/brctl addbr br0
        /usr/sbin/brctl setfd br0 0
        /usr/sbin/brctl addif br0 bond0
        /sbin/ifconfig br0 ${IP} netmask ${MASK} promisc up
        
        # Reconfigure the bond to be 0.0.0.0 and re-set up the gw
        /sbin/ifconfig bond0 0.0.0.0 up
        /sbin/route add default gw ${GATEWAY}

        # turn scatter-gather and tcp-segmentation-offload off on the bridge
        /usr/sbin/ethtool -K br0 sg off
        /usr/sbin/ethtool -K br0 tso off
    fi
         
    if [ "$1" = "down" ]
    then
        /sbin/ifconfig br0 down
        /usr/sbin/brctl delbr br0
        /sbin/ifenslave -d bond0 eth0 eth1
    fi
